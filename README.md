# Exchange rate recognition and calculation application

This project recognizes various currencies using the YOLOv10 model and calculates the equivalent values of four different currencies based on the exchange rates obtained in XML format from the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey.

The YOLOv10 model was trained with sample data, including 10 USD and 10 Turkish Lira, using Roboflow, resulting in the best_second.pt weight file. You can create your own weight files and use them in the model section to perform operations with your custom dataset.
